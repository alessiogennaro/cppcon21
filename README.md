# cppcon21
Code to accompany the talk "Generic Graph Libraries in C++20" at cppcon 21

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Note that you will need to have a C++ compiler that fully supports C++20.  If you need
to build with a different installed compiler, say, g++-11, invoke

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-11
```
